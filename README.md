Study On Loan Default Profiles In A Czech Bank
In the ensuing chaos that followed the collapse of the USSR, various former Soviet satellite states experienced differing levels of financial and developmental success. Our group is interested in examining a snapshot of financial transactions and data from the Czech Republic in the 1990s after its recent independence from the USSR and its amicable separation from Slovakia. By doing so, we aim to uncover insights, and patterns related to its financial information during this transformative period.
To facilitate a deeper understanding of the factors that lead to financial default, this project aims to uncover not only financial behaviors in the Czech Republic,  but also universal human payment default behavior as a whole. We hope to examine the relationships between transactional behaviors, account types, and customer demographics. We were inspired by previous research completed on the Berka data (Zhou Xu, 2020).
